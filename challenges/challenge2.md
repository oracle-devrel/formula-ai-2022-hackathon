# Introduction
This challenge is all about bringing to life a concept that we started to explore. It's has all to do with what should be the next level Replay Experience. Think about any events that generate 3 dimmensional data, and how those can be translated into impressive replays. Wheter it is for eSports, Live action sport events etc. 

We already have a working Swift/SwiftUI iPhone/iPad/Mac app, with a minimal user interface. The app connects to an Oracle Cloud API REST endpoint, where several individual F1 sessions are already recorded.

The existing code could be found in this repo.

# Challenge
In challenge 2 of this hackathon, we would like for you to tell us how UX should work and look like to deliver the most immersive AR Replay experience.
Anything goes... from pinching to zoom and rotate model to adding AI optimal path track.

# Solution Design
Here is a high level Solution Design.
For this challenge our focus is on Presentation Layer: AR channel.

## Swift/SwiftUI
Our App is based on ARKit, hence this challenge is specific to Swift developers. The current UX is based on SwiftUI, but we are can accept other solutions as well, though SwiftUI is preffered.

# Scoring
The following things will be taken into consideration when doing an independent evaluation of challenge 2:
1. Working, optimized Swift code. We put a premium on how smooth, fluid and immersive the UX is.
2. Video and any UX research done to backup your UI interaction flow
3. Wow factor - this is a bit subjective hence we will get our internal teams to vote on the favourite flow

<!-- ### Code Presentation and Readability

Clean code is code that is easy to understand and easy to change.

It's writing code that is:
- Readable (please follow https://google.github.io/swift/)
- Understandable
- Maintainable
- Extendable

We recommend adhering to the [PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#naming-conventions), but if the code is readable and easily understandable we will accept it as well as any other code adhering to the standard. -->

<!-- ### Using OCI

If you show that you've used OCI during this challenge, you will be awarded with **2 bonus points**. We suggest looking into Oracle Cloud Infrastructure as a possible services that could be useful during development / submission.

Here are some ideas for reference:
