# Introduction
Metaverse is booming and it is about to create a whole new interaction paradigm. Since Metaverse is relying on 3d assets that usually take a bit of time to model manually, we believe that using data to programmatically create 3d assets will benefit whole industry going forward. Using AI to programmatic create 3d asset is not a new concept and there are many Research & Development papers applying AI for various use cases spanning across animations, shaders, sculpting or converting 2d images to 3d assets.

# Challenge
In challenge 3 of this hackathon, we would like for you to create 3d track programmatically using Blender Python (BPY).

# Data Set Notes
Formula 1 races take place in different cities across the world. Your script needs to be scalable so that it can be apply it to other track coordinates.

## Blender Python API
Blender Python sits at the heart of this challenge, feel free to explore this page to get more info regarding how it works
https://docs.blender.org/api/current/info_quickstart.html

Blender Python API features:
1. Edit any data the user interface can (Scenes, Meshes, Particles etc.).
2. Modify user preferences, keymaps and themes.
3. Run tools with own settings.
4. Create user interface elements such as menus, headers and panels.
5. Create new tools.
6. Create interactive tools.
7. Create new rendering engines that integrate with Blender.
8. Subscribe to changes to data and itâ€™s properties.
9. Define new settings in existing Blender data.
10. Draw in the 3D Viewport using Python.

# Scoring
The following things will be taken into consideration when doing an independent evaluation of challenge 3:
1. BPY script running on our local machine. Including requirements.txt is a MUST.
2. BPY script will be independently tested with a different track with different track coordinates than the test track coordinates provided at the start of the hackathon.
3. BPY procedurally generating surface material
4. Wow factor - this is a bit subjective hence we will get our internal teams to vote on the favourite track/tracks. Show off your work by including the experience in your video presentation.

### Code Presentation and Readability

Clean code is code that is easy to understand and easy to change.

It's writing code that is:
- Readable
- Understandable
- Maintainable
- Extendable

We recommend adhering to the [PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#naming-conventions), but if the code is readable and easily understandable we will accept it as well as any other code adhering to the standard.

### Using OCI

We suggest looking into Oracle Cloud Infrastructure as a possible services that could be useful during development / submission.

Here are some ideas for reference:
